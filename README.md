# Project-Turtle
Repository for the "Project Turtle" project.

To do:
- image files should be renamed for easier use. (Art#1 could be Cutscene_#1)
- balancing at the end
- Make the cards work their magic
- Make it affect the player and enemy classes
- Make the enemy attack
- Cards need resizing, renaming and some minor editing. Also could use different stats on the same type of cards
