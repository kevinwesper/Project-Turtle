# Project-Turtle
Repository for the "Project Turtle" project.

To do:
- buttons folder should be deleted
- all the button classes will be 1 class with a basic button
- text will be added as button text (and maybe for in the cutscenes as well?)
- Screens folder should be screens
- image files should be renamed for easier use. (Art#1 could be Cutscene_#1)
- Edit your names in all the classes so it looks like everyone worked on the same things.
- Implement pictures
- User Interface class should be made
- Game progresses from cutscene to cutscene to battle to next cutscene etc.
- skip button is the "next" button
- Make all the cutscenes in different classes for now (We will have a lot of classes (and with a lot I mean too much))
- Make all the gamescreens in different classes (See, too many classes)
- Gamescreens should take player and enemy[#] from their classes as well as the gamerules class, the user interface class, and the
  placedcards class
- almost all classes need the card class
- balancing at the end

Program tasks divided:
- Kevin: Battle rules class
- Shaquille: placedcards class
- Georgi: Cards stuff
- Dea: player class
- Deborah: Enemy1 class
